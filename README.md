# Challenge
The execution is obvious - via main method:
> javac CruisSearch.java
> java CruisSearch

> javac PromoSearch.java
> java PromoSearch

Notes: 
The challenge took me more than an hour.
The PromoSearch is not complete:
Only the first question is done, and it's not perfect... still need to adjust dups removal of String[] from List<String[]>.

It was really interesting and engaging, though. It was a pleasant chunk of time spent on it. Thanks!
